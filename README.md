# Drew Boilerplate README

Not much here yet. Just have to get rid of this fuckin' NPM error.

## To Use

1. Clone the repo.
2. From root, type `npm install`.
3. Then type `gulp`.
4. Work in the `App/` folder. Gulp will compile everything into the `Build/` folder.
5. To view without cross-domain errors, you *must* use the URL `localhost:8080/build` in your browser.
6. To clean the `Build/` folder, type `gulp clean`.
